There is a string manipulation

var timezone = "America/New_York"
you gotta get rid of 3 things so replace occurances of the _ with an empty space
timezone.replaceOccurancesOf(or:   , with:   ) = "America New York" maybe get rid of this
then you can convert it to an array
string.separately(or: " / ") = [America, New York]
then return .last
